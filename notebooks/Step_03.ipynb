    "## Some boring stuff you need to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "Few people think about it, but text is incredibly complicated. Start with the alphabet. The people of Bougainville have the smallest alphabet in the world; their Rotokas alphabet is composed of only 12 letters: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. On the other end of the spectrum, languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have thousands of characters. English, of course, has 26 letters — 52 if you count uppercase and lowercase separately — plus a handful of **!@#$\\%&** punctuation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you talk about “text,” you’re probably thinking of “characters and symbols on my computer screen.” But computers don’t deal in characters and symbols; they deal in bits and bytes. Every piece of text you’ve ever seen on a computer screen is actually stored in a particular character encoding. Very roughly speaking, the character encoding provides a mapping between the stuff you see on your screen and the stuff your computer actually stores in memory and on disk. There are many different character encodings, some optimized for particular languages like Russian or Chinese or English, and others that can be used for multiple languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, it’s more complicated than that. Many characters are common to multiple encodings, but each encoding may use a different sequence of bytes to actually store those characters in memory or on disk. So you can think of the character encoding as a kind of decryption key. Whenever someone gives you a sequence of bytes — a file, a web page, whatever — and claims it’s “text,” you need to know what character encoding they used so you can decode the bytes into characters. If they give you the wrong key or no key at all, you’re left with the unenviable task of cracking the code yourself. Chances are you’ll get it wrong, and the result will be gibberish.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Everything you thought you knew about strings is wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely you’ve seen web pages like this, with strange question-mark-like characters where apostrophes should be. That usually means the page author didn’t declare their character encoding correctly, your browser was left guessing, and the result was a mix of expected and unexpected characters. In English it’s merely annoying; in other languages, the result can be completely unreadable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are character encodings for each major language in the world. Since each language is different, and memory and disk space have historically been expensive, each character encoding is optimized for a particular language. By that, I mean each encoding using the same numbers (0–255) to represent that language’s characters. For instance, you’re probably familiar with the ascii encoding, which stores English characters as numbers ranging from 0 to 127. (65 is capital “A”, 97 is lowercase “a”, &c.) English has a very simple alphabet, so it can be completely expressed in less than 128 numbers. For those of you who can count in base 2, that’s 7 out of the 8 bits in a byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "Western European languages like French, Spanish, and German have more letters than English. Or, more precisely, they have letters combined with various diacritical marks, like the ñ character in Spanish. The most common encoding for these languages is CP-1252, also called “windows-1252” because it is widely used on Microsoft Windows. The CP-1252 encoding shares characters with ascii in the 0–127 range, but then extends into the 128–255 range for characters like n-with-a-tilde-over-it (241), u-with-two-dots-over-it (252), &c. It’s still a single-byte encoding, though; the highest possible number, 255, still fits in one byte.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, which have so many characters that they require multiple-byte character sets. That is, each “character” is represented by a two-byte number from 0–65535. But different multi-byte encodings still share the same problem as different single-byte encodings, namely that they each use the same numbers to mean different things. It’s just that the range of numbers is broader, because there are many more characters to represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was mostly OK in a non-networked world, where “text” was something you typed yourself and occasionally printed. There wasn’t much “plain text”. Source code was ascii, and everyone else used word processors, which defined their own (non-text) formats that tracked character encoding information along with rich styling, &c. People read these documents with the same word processing program as the original author, so everything worked, more or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think about the rise of global networks like email and the web. Lots of “plain text” flying around the globe, being authored on one computer, transmitted through a second computer, and received and displayed by a third computer. Computers can only see numbers, but the numbers could mean different things. Oh no! What to do? Well, systems had to be designed to carry encoding information along with every piece of “plain text.” Remember, it’s the decryption key that maps computer-readable numbers to human-readable characters. A missing decryption key means garbled text, gibberish, or worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think about trying to store multiple pieces of text in the same place, like in the same database table that holds all the email you’ve ever received. You still need to store the character encoding alongside each piece of text so you can display it properly. Think that’s hard? Try searching your email database, which means converting between multiple encodings on the fly. Doesn’t that sound fun?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think about the possibility of multilingual documents, where characters from several languages are next to each other in the same document. (Hint: programs that tried to do this typically used escape codes to switch “modes.” Poof, you’re in Russian koi8-r mode, so 241 means Я; poof, now you’re in Mac Greek mode, so 241 means ώ.) And of course you’ll want to search those documents, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now cry a lot, because everything you thought you knew about strings is wrong, and there ain’t no such thing as “plain text.”\n",

    "## Unicode\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is a system designed to represent every character from every language. Unicode represents each letter, character, or ideograph as a 4-byte number. Each number represents a unique character used in at least one of the world’s languages. (Not all the numbers are used, but more than 65535 of them are, so 2 bytes wouldn’t be sufficient.) Characters that are used in multiple languages generally have the same number, unless there is a good etymological reason not to. Regardless, there is exactly 1 number per character, and exactly 1 character per number. Every number always means just one thing; there are no “modes” to keep track of. U+0041 is always 'A', even if your language doesn’t have an 'A' in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the face of it, this seems like a great idea. One encoding to rule them all. Multiple languages per document. No more “mode switching” to switch between encodings mid-stream. But right away, the obvious question should leap out at you. Four bytes? For every single character‽ That seems awfully wasteful, especially for languages like English and Spanish, which need less than one byte (256 numbers) to express every possible character. In fact, it’s wasteful even for ideograph-based languages (like Chinese), which never need more than two bytes per character.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a Unicode encoding that uses four bytes per character. It’s called UTF-32, because 32 bits = 4 bytes. UTF-32 is a straightforward encoding; it takes each Unicode character (a 4-byte number) and represents the character with that same number. This has some advantages, the most important being that you can find the Nth character of a string in constant time, because the Nth character starts at the 4×Nth byte. It also has several disadvantages, the most obvious being that it takes four freaking bytes to store every freaking character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there are a lot of Unicode characters, it turns out that most people will never use anything beyond the first 65535. Thus, there is another Unicode encoding, called UTF-16 (because 16 bits = 2 bytes). UTF-16 encodes every character from 0–65535 as two bytes, then uses some dirty hacks if you actually need to represent the rarely-used “astral plane” Unicode characters beyond 65535. Most obvious advantage: UTF-16 is twice as space-efficient as UTF-32, because every character requires only two bytes to store instead of four bytes (except for the ones that don’t). And you can still easily find the Nth character of a string in constant time, if you assume that the string doesn’t include any astral plane characters, which is a good assumption right up until the moment that it’s not.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are also non-obvious disadvantages to both UTF-32 and UTF-16. Different computer systems store individual bytes in different ways. That means that the character U+4E2D could be stored in UTF-16 as either 4E 2D or 2D 4E, depending on whether the system is big-endian or little-endian. (For UTF-32, there are even more possible byte orderings.) As long as your documents never leave your computer, you’re safe — different applications on the same computer will all use the same byte order. But the minute you want to transfer documents between systems, perhaps on a world wide web of some sort, you’re going to need a way to indicate which order your bytes are stored. Otherwise, the receiving system has no way of knowing whether the two-byte sequence 4E 2D means U+4E2D or U+2D4E.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, the multi-byte Unicode encodings define a “Byte Order Mark,” which is a special non-printable character that you can include at the beginning of your document to indicate what order your bytes are in. For UTF-16, the Byte Order Mark is U+FEFF. If you receive a UTF-16 document that starts with the bytes FF FE, you know the byte ordering is one way; if it starts with FE FF, you know the byte ordering is reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, UTF-16 isn’t exactly ideal, especially if you’re dealing with a lot of ascii characters. If you think about it, even a Chinese web page is going to contain a lot of ascii characters — all the elements and attributes surrounding the printable Chinese characters. Being able to find the Nth character in constant time is nice, but there’s still the nagging problem of those astral plane characters, which mean that you can’t guarantee that every character is exactly two bytes, so you can’t really find the Nth character in constant time unless you maintain a separate index. And boy, there sure is a lot of ascii text in the world…\n",
    "\n",
    "Other people pondered these questions, and they came up with a solution: **UTF-8**\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding system for Unicode. That is, different characters take up a different number of bytes. For ascii characters (A-Z, &c.) utf-8 uses just one byte per character. In fact, it uses the exact same bytes; the first 128 characters (0–127) in utf-8 are indistinguishable from ascii. “Extended Latin” characters like ñ and ö end up taking two bytes. (The bytes are not simply the Unicode code point like they would be in UTF-16; there is some serious bit-twiddling involved.) Chinese characters like 中 end up taking three bytes. The rarely-used “astral plane” characters take four bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: because each character can take a different number of bytes, finding the Nth character is an O(N) operation — that is, the longer the string, the longer it takes to find a specific character. Also, there is bit-twiddling involved to encode characters into bytes and decode bytes into characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: super-efficient encoding of common ascii characters. No worse than UTF-16 for extended Latin characters. Better than UTF-32 for Chinese characters. Also (and you’ll have to trust me on this, because I’m not going to show you the math), due to the exact nature of the bit twiddling, there are no byte-ordering issues. A document encoded in utf-8 uses the exact same stream of bytes on any computer."

If you want to take a sequence of bytes and turn it into a string, Python 3 can help you with that too. Bytes are not characters; bytes are bytes. Characters are an abstraction.

There is a pleasing symmetry here. In this 44-character string, a_string[:18] returns the first 18 characters, and a_string[18:] returns everything but the first 18 characters. In fact, a_string[:n] will always return the first n characters, and a_string[n:] will return the rest, regardless of the length of the string."
