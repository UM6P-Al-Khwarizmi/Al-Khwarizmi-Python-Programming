    "# Native DataTypes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, every value has a datatype, but you don’t need to declare the datatype of variables. How does that work? Based on each variable’s original assignment, Python figures out what type it is and keeps tracks of that internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many native datatypes. Here are the important ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Booleans are either True or False.\n",
    "2. Numbers can be integers (1 and 2), floats (1.1 and 1.2), fractions (1/2 and 2/3), or even complex numbers.\n",
    "3. Strings are sequences of Unicode characters, e.g. an html document.\n",
    "4. Bytes and byte arrays, e.g. a jpeg image file.\n",
    "5. Lists are ordered sequences of values.\n",
    "6. Tuples are ordered, immutable sequences of values.\n",
    "7. Sets are unordered bags of values.\n",
    "8. Dictionaries are unordered bags of key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are more types than these. Everything is an object in Python, so there are types like module, function, class, method, file, and even compiled code. You’ve already seen some of these: modules have names, functions have docstrings, &c. You’ll learn about classes in Classes & Iterators, and about files in Files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings and bytes are important enough — and complicated enough — that they get their own chapter. Let’s look at the others first."

    "## Booleans\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans are either true or false. Python has two constants, cleverly named True and False, which can be used to assign boolean values directly. Expressions can also evaluate to a boolean value. In certain places (like if statements), Python expects an expression to evaluate to a boolean value. These places are called boolean contexts. You can use virtually any expression in a boolean context, and Python will try to determine its truth value. Different datatypes have different rules about which values are true or false in a boolean context. (This will make more sense once you see some concrete examples later in this chapter.)\n",

    "①\tYou can get a part of a list, called a “slice”, by specifying two indices. The return value is a new list containing all the items of the list, in order, starting with the first slice index (in this case xs[1]), up to but not including the second slice index (in this case xs[3]).\n",
    "\n",
    "②\tSlicing works if one or both of the slice indices is negative. If it helps, you can think of it this way: reading the list from left to right, the first slice index specifies the first item you want, and the second slice index specifies the first item you don’t want. The return value is everything in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "③\tLists are zero-based, so xs[0:3] returns the first three items of the list, starting at xs[0], up to but not including xs[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "④\tIf the left slice index is 0, you can leave it out, and 0 is implied. So xs[:3] is the same as xs[0:3], because the starting 0 is implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "⑤\tSimilarly, if the right slice index is the length of the list, you can leave it out. So xs[3:] is the same as xs[3:5], because this list has five items. There is a pleasing symmetry here. In this five-item list, xs[:3] returns the first 3 items, and xs[3:] returns the last two items. In fact, xs[:n] will always return the first n items, and xs[n:] will return the rest, regardless of the length of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "⑥\tIf both slice indices are left out, all items of the list are included. But this is not the same as the original xs variable. It is a new list that happens to have all the same items. xs[:] is shorthand for making a complete copy of a list."

    "①\tThe + operator concatenates lists to create a new list. A list can contain any number of items; there is no size limit (other than available memory). However, if memory is a concern, you should be aware that list concatenation creates a second list in memory. In this case, that new list is immediately assigned to the existing variable xs. So this line of code is really a two-step process — concatenation then assignment — which can (temporarily) consume a lot of memory when you’re dealing with large lists.\n",

    "\n",
    "⑤\tThe insert() method inserts a single item into a list. The first argument is the index of the first item in the list that will get bumped out of position. List items do not need to be unique; for example, there are now two separate items with the value 'Ω': the first item, xs[0], and the last item, xs[6].\n",

    "\n",
    "④\tIf you start with a list of six items and append a list onto it, you end up with... a list of seven items. Why seven? Because the last item (which you just appended) is itself a list.

This is notably different from most languages, which will return some invalid index (like -1). While this may seem annoying at first, I think you will come to appreciate it. It means your program will crash at the source of the problem instead of failing strangely and silently later. Remember, -1 is a valid list index. If the index() method returned -1, that could lead to some not-so-fun debugging sessions!"
